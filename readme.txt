Website ownership verification to allow you to connect your Wordpress website to a MobiPromo mobile app.

== Description ==

MobiPromo is an online mobile app builder that you can use to create a mobile app for your Wordpress website.

The mobile app itself can be created and configured at [https://getmobipromo.com/](https://getmobipromo.com/) - it's easy and free!

It will add a meta tag to the head section of your web pages with a key that you obtain when you create your MobiPromo mobile app.
